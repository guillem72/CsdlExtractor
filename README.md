# CsdlExtractor
Extract with php CLI the titles of the articles and their related terms 
form a search in computers.org.
 I have used it with php 7 on linux ubuntu,
but it is likely that it would work with php 5.


Put the html results from searches in html 
directory and execute main.php (php main.php) to see the results. 
For getting the webpages I have developed
 [jsCSDLscraping](https://github.com/guillem72/jsCSDLscraping).
